# CS1.1-Bank_Account_Project
 This is a bank account program written in Python 3.7.9 using OOP concepts

 In short, users are able to create a fictional bank account that they are able to deposit and withdrawl from. Additionally, users are also able to check their balance, print a receipt of their account information (name, account number, routing number, balance), and even add monthly interest. 

 As these bank accounts are fictional, all data is lost upon program termination.

 This is currently the extent of my program.
